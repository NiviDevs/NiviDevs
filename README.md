# 👋 Hi, I'm Nevedya

I'm an ECE undergrad at VIT, currently learning full-stack development and CLI tools.  
This repo is my **public devlog** where I track progress, log problems, and build cool stuff.

## 🚀 What I'm Doing Right Now:
- 🌱 Working on a hackathon management system using React-Router and MongoDB + Express + Socketio

---
<!--


- 📅 Daily logging my progress (see `devlog/`)
- 💻 Solving DSA problems (see `dsa/`)

## 🗓️ Devlog
Check out [`/devlog`](./devlog) to see what I'm learning and building every day.

## 🧩 Projects
I document and reflect on all my mini-projects in [`/projects`](./projects)
